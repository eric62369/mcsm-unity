### Project Description
Second iteration of platformer type 2D game. Currently still early in development.
My motivation was just to create something fun but on a larger scale than I had done before. This project is a place for me to put a mix of programming and technical skills as well as artistic skills.

### Next Steps
Most of the project is still unmade, but currently a prototype of one boss room is created and "playable."
Lots of the work will come to content creation, since most of the player's basic game systems are created.
